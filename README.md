This repo is:
A space for all the projects we do in AUE 8230. This will involve utilizing ROS to make a turtlebot do some fancy maneuvers hopefully without too much damage to the property or itself. Only time will tell. 

I am:
A PhD student at Clemson University. I am currently working in stochastic planning and control. My interests include, vehicle dynamics, controls(obvi), and computer vision. I have many other interests and hobbies outside of that, but those are best discussed over a beer.
